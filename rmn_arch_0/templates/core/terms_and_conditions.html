    </p>

    <h2>Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Except as set forth hereinabove, you and we agree that we will resolve
        any disputes between us (including any disputes between you and a
        third-party agent of ours) through binding and final arbitration instead
        of through court proceedings. You and we hereby waive any right to a
        jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies, claims,
        counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us or you and a
        third-party agent of ours (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for
        binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American
        Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and
        determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such
        arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be
        enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that
        the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the
        existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without
        limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or
        exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will
        not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may
        lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the
        arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of
        securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as
        specifically permitted by state law. The Federal Arbitration Act and
        federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. However, the
        Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall
        have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
        interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these
        Terms of Service including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any
        part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
        compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the
        administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration
        as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration
        from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion
        the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among
        the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        This arbitration agreement does not preclude either party from seeking
        action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also
        have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In
        addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent
        jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments
        or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed
        incompatible with these Terms of Service, nor a waiver of the right to
        have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms of
        Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney
        general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with
        respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or
        representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our
        individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims
        of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The
        arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief
        available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory
        relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the
        arbitrator may not issue a “public injunction” and any such “public
        injunction” may be awarded only by a federal or state court. If either
        party seeks a “public injunction,” all other claims and prayers for
        relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim
        for a “public injunction” in federal or state court stayed until the
        arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can
        adjudicate the party’s claim or prayer for “public injunctive relief.”
        In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of
        claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or
        unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and
        effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall
        continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this
        Section of the Terms of Service will be effective or enforceable unless
        recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or
        requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion
        of this Terms of Service. This Section of the Terms will survive the
        termination of your relationship with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        This present Section entitled “Arbitration” shall only apply to Users
        located in the United States of America.
    </p>
    <p>
        THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A
        COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY
        FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY
        EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND
        FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO
        MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
    </p>

        between you and us shall be governed by the laws of Cyprus, without

        Service shall constitute an agreement to the application of the laws of

        condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by
        us to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not
        constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court
        of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not
